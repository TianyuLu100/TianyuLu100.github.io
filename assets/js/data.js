The 2D semiconductor is a transition-metal dichalcogenide (WS2), which has a crystalline structure that becomes ‘direct-gap’ as we thin it to a single layer. In a ‘direct-gap material,’ the minimum energy level in the conduction band and the maximum energy level in the valence band occur at the same crystal momentum (k-value), allowing for electrons to transition between bands easily by absorbing or emitting photons. As such, these materials are very efficient light-emitters and can effectively be used as fluorescent probes in our voltage sensing device. Moreover, due to the atomically-thin geometry of these materials, they are extremely sensitive to surface electric fields: even those as weak as those produced by neurons."

Thus, to achieve this, we must apply a uniform initial electrical potential to the entire monolayer. The method that we have proposed is to deposit a grid of thin metal traces directly on top of the 2D semiconductor, which, when connected to an external voltage source, will create a uniform electrostatic distribution across the entire monolayer, providing the initial carrier density required for high responsivity."

The exposed photoresist was then removed and a Chrome Etcher was used to remove the chrome layer in areas where the photoresist was originally exposed. I then spincoated a bilayer configuration of photoresist onto our wafer, exposed the wafer using our fabricated photomask, and removed the exposed photoresist using developer solution. After obtaining a wafer with successful patterning of resist, the Angstrom NexDep E-Beam evaporator was used to deposit several layers of metal (gold and titanium) on the wafer. Upon the completion of the deposition, the wafer was placed into a heated dish of 1165 microposit remover for several hours for metal liftoff. During this process, the underlying photoresist is dissolved away, carrying away any metal deposited on top of it and leaving only the metal in the original pattern that I designed."
